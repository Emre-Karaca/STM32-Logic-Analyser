# STM32 Logic Analyser
A DIY logic analyzer project built with STM32 microcontroller, designed to capture and visualize digital signals from GPIO pins. The system communicates with a MATLAB-based user interface (UI) for real-time data visualization.

## Key Features:
2-channel data capture using STM32 GPIO.
Real-time signal visualization with time-based plotting on MATLAB UI.
Communication via USART between STM32 and PC.
Custom-designed probe for signal measurement.

## Installation and Setup:
Clone the repository.
Flash the STM32 with the provided firmware.
Connect the logic analyzer to the target device using the custom probe.
Use the MATLAB interface to configure settings and visualize signals.

## Included Files:
MATLAB UI files for data visualization.
STM32 project files for firmware development.
Probe diagrams and design details.
