# STM32 Logic Analyser
A DIY logic analyzer project built with STM32 microcontroller, designed to capture and visualize digital signals from GPIO pins. The system communicates with a MATLAB-based user interface (UI) for real-time data visualization.

## Key Features:
2-channel data capture using STM32 GPIO.
Real-time signal visualization with time-based plotting on a MATLAB UI.
Communication via UART between STM32 and PC.
Custom-designed probe for signal measurement.

## Hardware Requirements:
Microcontroller: STM32F401RE
Probe: 1kΩ, 10kΩ, and 220Ω resistors, BAT54 diodes and a 0.1uF capacitor for a single probe. Circuit diagram is given.

## Included Files:
MATLAB UI files for data visualization.
STM32 project files for firmware development.
Probe diagrams and design details.
